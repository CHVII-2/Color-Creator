# Using the Affinity Designer template

The Color Creator Affinity Designer template can be used to explore color variations, and build nice color palettes. It works by providing blending options that aren’t normally found in color pickers in design tools — blending between two or three custom colours, or blending using a blending mode (overlay is used by default, but you can change it if you’d like).

It generates lots of variations that can be used to build your color palette.

The base colors can be changed by editing the global document colors named __Color 1__, __Color 2__, __Color 3__ etc (found in the swatches panel). When you’ve chosen some base colors you’re happy with, select a Swatch layer in the Swatches group and fill it with a color picked from the canvas — this can be done by double clicking the layer thumbnail in the layers panel, then click on the canvas to pick a blended color.

You can export the palette using the __Swatches__ slice in the Export Persona, to share it with others.
